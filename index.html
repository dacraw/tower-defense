          <p class="game-summary">Tower Defense is a game where you must survive by building towers that automatically attack incoming enemies. You get a 10 second break in between levels, and may build and/or upgrade towers anytime after starting the game. Resources generate automatically, and resource generation should be upgraded in order to afford more upgrades. Once you build a tower, you may click on it on the battlefield to view its stats, upgrade it or sell it. Towers deal more damage as they level up.</p>

          <div class="left">
            <h1>LEFT SIDEBAR</h1>
            <p>Your current resources are at the top of the left sidebar.</p>
            <p>Increase income by clicking "Boost Income" in the left sidebar. The cost to upgrade resource generation will increase each time you do it. </p>
            <p>Add towers by clicking the tower type in the left sidebar. The cost of the tower is listed there.</p>

            <p>Score increases with damage dealt.</p>
            <p>Advance to the next level by defeating all current enemies. Enemies become stronger with each new level.</p>
            <p>Health decreases by 1 each time an enemy reaches your base. When your health reaches 0, you lose.</p>
            <p>Number of enemies for the current level is displayed in the right sidebar.</p>

          <h1>TOWER UI</h1>
          <p>After the game has started, you may build towers. Once a tower has been built, click on it to view individual stats for the tower, such as its level, current damage, enemies defeated & upgrade cost. Use this interface to upgrade the tower or sell it. Each tower's stats are not shared across towers -- they belong to that individual tower.</p>  
          <ul class="tower-interface-bullets">
            <li>For every 10 enemies defeated, a tower gains a level.</li>
            <li>Every time a tower levels, its TOTAL DAMAGE is boosted by 10%.</li>
            <li>Each time a tower is upgraded, its BASE DAMAGE increases by 10%.</li>
            <li>Selling a tower refunds its FULL COST - including base cost + upgrades.</li>
